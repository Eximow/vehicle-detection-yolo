# vehicle-detection-yolo
Vehicle Detection with YOLOv8 and OpenCV   This project uses the YOLOv8 object detection model together with OpenCV to detect and count vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks) in images. The script highlights detected vehicles with bounding boxes, labels them with confidence scores, and displays the total count directly on the output image.
