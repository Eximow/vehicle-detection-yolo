# 🚗 Vehicle Detection with YOLO and OpenCV

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **vehicle detection** using the YOLO object detection model combined with OpenCV.  
It can detect and count different types of vehicles such as **cars, motorcycles, buses, and trucks** in images or video streams.  
Detected vehicles are highlighted with bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores.

## ✨ Features
- Detect multiple vehicle classes (car, motorcycle, bus, truck)  
- Draw bounding boxes and confidence scores on detected objects  
- Count and display the total number of detected vehicles  
- Works on both images and video streams
